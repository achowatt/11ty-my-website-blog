My name is Anna Chowattanakul. I am currently working at Codeboxx as a web developer working on large e-commerce project. I love writing clean code and building accessible, beautiful and responsive web/mobile applications with great performance. In my spare time I love playing jazz piano, mastering the kalimba and making delicious Thai food. I'm always open to meeting new people so don't hesitate to reach out!
